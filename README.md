# Project-Management-Dashboard
We are developing a project management dashboard for the developer teams in the company which will show informationabout the status of the projects, future plans, release plans, complaints from the costumers, issues,risks, bugs status, etc. in an interactive graphical and tabular form.

Back-End is restful web service(JAX-RS framework) which also generates json data which is given to front end made in angular-js framework using different web technology. Because of angular-js framework we made it single page application  which gets json data from back-end.
